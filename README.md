## Description

 
Making a foreign country home: This is not only about learning the language. You also want to explore your region, understand what’s going on on a political level, participate in cultural events, and connect with the community. Media could provide the international community with this information - but much of it doesn't reach them because it is not on the language level they need. 
 
Why not? Because it’s difficult for journalists to write for an audience with limited German skills. It requires learning to express oneself naturally using a limited vocabulary and simplified grammar;  a skill that journalists currently train themselves on by constantly checking lists of learner’s vocabulary to learn them by heart.  Journalists should be spending their efforts on empathizing with their target group, not checking vocabulary lists!  
 
Our software,  Easy Peasy, makes writing simplified articles effortless.  Easy Peasy is an online text editor that checks your text in real time; it points you to any word that is not included in the basic vocabulary of the language level you are writing for.  Future updates will include suggestions for simplified word alternatives, analysis of the readability and overall difficulty of the text, and portals for readers to access simplified content.
 
Like this, it gets easier for journalists to adapt and/or create meaningful content for an increasingly important target group, and it helps new arrivals in a country adjust and integrate into their new home.
